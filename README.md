# 🧠 Programming Logic Exercises

A collection of programming logic exercises and solutions to improve algorithmic thinking, problem-solving skills, and mastery of core programming concepts.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository was created to practice and improve logical reasoning using code. Here you'll find exercises on:

- Conditionals
- Loops
- Recursion
- Arrays & Strings
- Dictionaries / HashMaps
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.)
- Practice problems for interviews and challenges

## 💻 Language

Most exercises will be implemented using **C#**, but logic applies to any language.
